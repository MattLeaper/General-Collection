This collection of work over the previous year includes:

Multiple model classification of the MNIST organ dataset for image classification alongside a confusion matrix to go with the models

A sentiment analysis model classifies the sentiment of tweets and reviews for various companies, including Nokia and Rotten Tomatoes, using strengthening and diminishing words along with other NLP rules
A face verification classifier to detect whether two faces are the same, this was built to be used on an unseen test, so the use of JOBLIB was needed not to retrain the model for each epoch

A maths-based game written in Java, in which the user has to calculate the correct number of tomatoes. This game has increasing difficulty, alongside an SQL database for login and high scores.
